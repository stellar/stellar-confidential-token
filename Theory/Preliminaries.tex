\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:Preliminaries}

\subsection{Notation} 
We use calligraphic letters to denote sets, uppercase for random variables, and lowercase for integers and functions. %All logarithms considered here are base $2$. 
Let $\N$ denote the set of natural numbers.  For $n\in \N$, let $[n] \eqdef \set{1,\ldots,n}$ and $(n) \eqdef \set{0,\ldots,n}$.  For a relation $\cR$, let $\cL(\cR)$ denote its underlying language, \ie  $\cL(\cR) \eqdef \set{x\colon \exists w \colon (x,w) \in \cR}$.    We number the element of a vector starting from $0$, \ie $v_0,v_1,
\ldots,$


\subsection{Homomorphic Encryption}
An homomorphic encryption over $\Z_q$ is a triplet $(\KeyGen,\Enc,\Dec)$ of efficient algorithms, with the standard correctness and semantic security properties.  In addition, there exist an efficient  addition operation denote $+$  such that for uniformly  generated public key  $\pk$, and any two  messages $x_0,x_1\in \Z_q$,  it holds that  $\Enc_\pk(x_0) + \Enc_\pk(x_1) $ are computationally indistinguishable from $\Enc_\pk(x_0+ x_1 \bmod q)$.


\begin{remark}[Implicit  randomness]
When calling  \KeyGen or \Enc, or any other randomized algorithms,  we sometimes explicitly provide the random coins. When we do not, it means that the algorithm sample them by itself. 
\end{remark}
